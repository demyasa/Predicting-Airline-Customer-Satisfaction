# Predicting Airline Customer Satisfaction

## Description

Understanding how satisfied a customer is with the level of service offered by an airline can either propel the company forward or result in its downfall. Recognizing which services are particularly important to a consumer, provide both existing and budding airlines with the tools necessary to stand out among their competition. Working with the data available on passenger satisfaction and the services offered by multiple US airlines will discern which amenities are insignificant and which amenities need further attention, or even incorporation into an airlineâ€™s business model.
